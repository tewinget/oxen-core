    //    whether we need to switch our active provider (i.e. if the primary provider is too far
    //    behind, or we're on a backup but the primary looks good again).  Whatever node we end
    //    deciding to use defines our new current height, and we proceed to step 3.
    // 2. otherwise (no multiple providers, or we aren't due to rechecked them) fetch the updated
    //    height from our current active provider.  Proceed to 3.
    // 3. If we are missing reward info for a recent reward height block (i.e. those divisible by
    //    L2_REWARD_POOL_UPDATE_BLOCKS), fetch the updated reward data.  We generally keep the most
    //    recent and second-most recent on hand, and so this step will repeat if we need both.  Once
    //    we've done any reward updates (or if none were needed) proceed to 4.
    // 4. Log updating.  We fetch logs, starting at the next block height after the most recent log
    //    fetch (or HIST_SIZE ago, if that is later), giving us ethereum events for node actions.
    //    We fetch at most 100 (by default, but confirable) at a time, and as each set of logs comes
    //    back repeat this step until we have fetched all logs up to the current height.  Any such
    //    witnessed events are added to the mempool for inclusion in new blocks and are used for
    //    confirm (or deny) L2 events that are still awaiting confirmation.

    //    check we performed then we fetch the full set of current nodes from the contract; any
    //    nodes present in the oxend service node list that are neither present in the contract nor
    //    present in the list of recent removal/liquidation events becauses a node to be purged.

    //    node from the network.  If this request fails because the height is quite old then we
